   The Paddle OCR project contains many OCR deep learning models, going from text detection, text recognition, text angle detection and table layout models to extract text found tables in a image
Steps involved :
1.Text recognition: PaddleOCR provides multiple pre-trained OCR models that can be used to recognize text in different languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
2.Text detection: PaddleOCR also provides pre-trained models for detecting text regions in images and documents. These models can be used to locate the position of text in an image or a scanned document.
3.Table recognition: PaddleOCR includes a table recognition module that can detect and extract tables from images and documents.
4.Document layout analysis: PaddleOCR can analyze the layout of a document and extract different regions, such as text blocks, tables, and images.
5.End-to-end OCR pipeline: PaddleOCR provides an end-to-end OCR pipeline that can automatically detect text regions, recognize text, and output the results in various formats, including text, JSON, and HTML.
